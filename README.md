# Assignment 9: Neural Networks

## Overview
This project is focused on implementing and experimenting with neural networks using Python. It includes the necessary scripts and tools to set up, train, and evaluate neural network models.

## Repository Structure
- `src/`: Contains the main source code for the project.
- `data/`: Contains datasets used for training and evaluation.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks demonstrating the usage and results of the neural network models.
- `tests/`: Unit tests for the project.

## Setup and Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/riteshr19/ritesh19-assignment-9.git
   cd riteshr19-assignment-9
Create and activate a virtual environment:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage

To train and evaluate the neural network models, you can use the provided scripts in the src/ directory. For example:
python src/train_model.py --data data/dataset.csv --epochs 50
Additionally, you can explore the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ directory for detailed examples and visualizations.
